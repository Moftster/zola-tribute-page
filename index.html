<h2>Biography</h2>

<p> Gianfranco Zola is one of the Premier League's greatest every players. Born in Oliena in Southern Italy in 1966, Zola signed his first professional contract with Sardinian team Nuorese in 1984 and went on to play for a number of clubs including Parma, Napoli and Cagliari.

<p>Signed by then manager Ruud Gullit in November 1996 for £4.5 million, he was one of several continental players to join the Blues' ranks in the mid-nineties. In his debut season he demonstrated his skill and talent, and put in several notable performances, scoring a series of memorable goals.</p>

<p>In February 1997, after taking the ball around Manchester United's defence in the penalty area before slotting the ball past goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel, he was described by United manager Alex Ferguson as a "clever little so-and-so."</p>

<p>He was a key player in Chelsea's resurgence in the 1996–97 season, helping them win the FA Cup with a 2–0 win over Middlesbrough at Wembley Stadium having scored four goals en route to the final, including a 25-yard curling shot against Liverpool as Chelsea came from 0–2 behind to win 4–2, and a memorable goal of individual skill in the semi-final against Wimbledon, backheeling the ball and turning 180 degrees before slotting the ball into the net. At the end of the season he was voted FWA Player of the Year, the only player ever to win the accolade without playing a full season in the English league and the first Chelsea player to win it.</p>

<p>In 2003, Zola was voted as the best ever Chelsea player by Chelsea's fans.</p>
